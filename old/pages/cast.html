    The series focuses on the brothers Dean Winchester and Sam Winchester,
    played by Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki, as they travel throughout the
    country hunting down evil supernatural creatures. Padalecki became
    interested in the role because he liked horror series, including both The
    X-Files and The Twilight Zone, which he found similar to the proposed plot
    of Supernatural. He was also excited to play "the reluctant hero", comparing
    Sam to The Matrix's Neo and Luke Skywalker of Star Wars. Padalecki had
    previous experience working with executive producers McG and David
    Nutter,[60] the former convincing him to audition for the role.[61] Ackles
    was originally asked by Nutter to audition for the role of Sam[62] but
    preferred the character of Dean after reading the script.[63] At the time of
    his audition, he was already a series regular on fellow WB series
    Smallville. After landing the part of Dean, his Smallville role was cut
    short.[64]

    When I read the script, Dean just jumped out at me. With that character
    there was always a bit more comedy, and a bit more recklessness, and it just
    appealed to me more. So when I asked to read for that, they were like,
    "That's what we're looking for." So it was great. I found a character that I
    really enjoy playing. — Jensen Ackles on what drew him to the character of
    Dean Winchester[63]

    While the series does not have many lead characters, there are many
    recurring characters. Jeffrey Dean Morgan portrays John Winchester, father
    of Sam and Dean. Making an appearance in the pilot episode, John does not
    return until nearly halfway through the first season, after which he becomes
    a recurring character until his eventual death in the second season's
    premiere episode, though his spirit returns to help his sons in the season
    finale. Later in the series, it is announced that John Winchester fathered a
    third son with another woman; a half-brother to Sam and Dean. According to
    writer John Shiban, it was decided early on that John would die. The writers
    found that having the brothers being separated from their father "split the
    show". Shiban noted that "... the boys were looking for Dad, and they were
    looking for a monster of the week, whatever that is, whatever case crosses
    their path. It became difficult, because we thought it was like – 'what is
    Dad doing? Is he doing more interesting things than the boys are doing, or
    what?'"[65] They believed Morgan was initially reluctant about returning to
    Supernatural for the second season because of his recurring role on the
    series Grey's Anatomy.[66] Future appearances of the character have been
    hindered by Morgan's busy schedule.[67]

    Also introduced in the first season are the demon Azazel and his unnamed
    daughter. While Azazel mainly appears merely as shadows or silhouettes in
    the first season, taking physical form only when he possesses John
    Winchester, Azazel's daughter uses a girl named Meg Masters—portrayed by
    Nicki Lynn Aycox—as a host.[68] In the second-season premiere, Azazel's host
    is portrayed by Fredric Lehne; originally brought on for only one episode,
    Lehne impressed the showrunners so much that he was asked to return for the
    season's two-part finale.[69] Even after the character's death, Azazel makes
    appearances in subsequent seasons, being portrayed by different actors.
    Lehne also reprises the role in the first episode of season six when Dean is
    poisoned and begins to see Azazel again. Likewise, after Azazel's daughter
    is exorcised from Meg towards the end of the first season, the demon and her
    host continued to appear in the series, although now as two separate
    characters. Aycox continued her role in the fourth season when the angry
    spirit of Meg tries to kill the Winchesters. The demon returns for an
    episode in the second season played by Padalecki, temporarily taking Sam as
    a host. She appears once again in the fifth season, her newest host being
    portrayed by Rachel Miner, in a recurring role.
